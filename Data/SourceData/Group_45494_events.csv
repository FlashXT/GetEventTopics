The upscale, 457-room Hotel Nacional de Cuba is the country's grande dame, with a fascinating and storied history, ranging from a major mafia meeting in the '40s that took place on-site to tunnels in the gardens used during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The common spaces, including the lobby and the ocean-view gardens, are gorgeous, casting light on Havana’s golden age of Cuban hospitality, nightlife and entertainment.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/5/a/600_464672858.jpeg"" /></p> <p>This will be followed by a ride in a classic convertible car around Havana City! Havana is a beloved by American visitors as a cache of thousands of vintage American cars, manufactured before the revolution and subsequent US embargo in 1960. In the absence of automobile imports, these living relics are preserved by Cuban mechanics and improvised fixes by the owners themselves. Experience an hour in a classic convertible Chevy, Ford or Oldsmobile.</p> <p><b>Saturday, October 28-Architecture Tour/Private Concert/Ernest Hemingway Home</b><br/>We’ll start our morning off by a walking tour to visit Old Havana and learn about Havana’s world-renowned UNESCO heritage designated architecture. There is no better introduction to Havana than a walk through Old Havana. On this walk you will see Old Havana’s 5 major plazas and explore the interiors of cathedrals and other important buildings. UNESCO designated Old Havana as a world heritage site in 1982. Although today, Havana is a sprawling metropolis of more than 2 million people, the old center retains an interesting mix of Baroque and neoclassical monuments, beautiful balconies and courtyards.<br/>Visit the Taller de la Grafica to meet lithographers at their collective Located in the heart of the old city, Taller de La Grafica de la Havana is one of Havana’s most revered artistic attractions, featuring Lithograph artists who create and sell their own experimental work on site. Visitors are treated to explanations of the collective’s equipment and techniques from the artists themselves and can purchase art directly from the Taller.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/6/c/600_464672876.jpeg"" /></p> <p>After lunch at a paladar, we’ll experience a private concert​ with a professional music group followed by a visit to the home of Ernest Hemingway: “Finca la Vigia”<br/>In 1940 Hemingway, with his new wife Martha, purchased a home outside Havana, where the couple lived for the next twenty years. The Hemingway’s named the site Finca Vigia, or “lookout farm,” and shared their home with dozens of Hemingway’s beloved cats, as well as trophies from many successful hunts and fishing expeditions.</p> <p><b>Sunday, October 29-Fine Arts Museum/Callejon de Hamel Afro Cuban Dancing and Drumming</b><br/>We’ll start our morning off with a visit to the Fine Arts Museum with an expert private guide. Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana is a museum of Fine Arts that exhibits Cuban art collections from the colonial times up to contemporary generations. It was founded on February 23, 1913 due to the efforts of its first director, Emilio Heredia, a well-known architect. In 1954, a new Palacio of Bellas Artes was opened, designed by the architect Rodriguez Pichardo. You will have the opportunity to explore this gem with an expert, private guide.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/6/f/600_464672879.jpeg"" /></p> <p>After the museum, we’ll visit the Callejon de Hamel for an Afro Cuban dancing and Drumming. Callejón de Hamel is a small alley derived from the name of a wealthy trader Fernando Hamel who maintained the entire district. Today it has become a place where the Afro Cuban art and Cuban traditions are practiced. The surrounding houses and buildings are covered with large murals in vivid colors. Tiny shops sell small pieces of Cuban art, hand carved wooden statues, paintings, and Santeria art. Aside from its funky street murals and psychedelic art shops, the main reason to come here is the frenetic rumba music that kicks off every Sunday at around noon.</p> <p>After lunch at a paladar we’ll visit Fusterlandia, the home and gallery and mosaic art neighborhood of Jose Fuster, the Picasso of the Caribbean. As you leave Havana and enter Fusterlandia, you find yourself at the studio and residence of José Rodriguez Fuster. Geographically you will be in Jaimanitas, at the northwestern edge of the Cuban capital, but Jaimanitas has changed a lot since Fuster (as everyone here calls him) got to town 30 years ago and set about remaking the neighborhood in his own image.<br/>The late afternoon will take us to see a Cuban Jazz concert with a young, award-winning artist A nighttime suggestion is a visit to the Cuban Art Factory</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/0/7/4/600_464672884.jpeg"" /></p> <p>The idea is borrowed from Brooklyn and Berlin and everywhere else where old warehouse spaces are being repurposed as art galleries and/or performance venues. However, the Factory is 100 percent criollo, all Cuban, in both its ownership and operation. The Factory is the creation of X Alfonso, a popular Cuban rocker and features a 4-floor art gallery/film space/live music space as well as several outdoor and indoor bars.</p> <p><b>Monday, October 30-Havana-USA</b><br/>If time permits in the morning before depart flight we’ll visit the San Jose Craft Market. San Jose craft market is Havana s largest craft market, offering clothing, paintings, tourist souvenirs, ceramics, baseball bats, jewelry, and a multitude of other products. It is open daily 9am-5pm. This harbor side warehouse was built in 1885 and is considered the oldest depository in Old Havana.</p> <p><i>This itinerary is subject to change.

This is a must area of Scotland not to be missed~!</i></p> <p>Our first stop is the delightful village of Dunkeld with a history stretching back to the 9th Century. Time to explore the ancient cathedral grounds and take a walk through mature woodland along the mighty River Tay. We continue north to the Pass of Killiecrankie, Cairngorm National Park and Laggan, an area favored by movie makers because of its wild mountain scenery and misty lochs.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/a/a/f/600_460635023.jpeg"" /></p> <p>We'll follow the Great Glen to Invergarry, stopping for a photo of Scotland’s highest mountain Ben Nevis.

This narrow valley is where the bloody massacre of the Macdonalds took place in 1692 and one of the most notorious acts in Scotland’s long and violent history.</p> <p><img src=""https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/b/8/7/600_460635239.jpeg"" /></p> <p><b>Tuesday, August 15: Open Day in Glencoe</b><br/>The Glencoe area is an outdoor haven.

A 12th century castle, completely remodeled inside and out during the 18th and 19th century. It became the principal residence for the Butler family for almost 600 years until 1971 when it was given to the people of Kilkenny for a token sum of 50 pounds.<br/>After our tour of the castle, we will drive to the seaport town of Kinsale, known as the ""culinary capital"" of the southwest.<br/>Overnight Kinsale</p> <p><b>Tuesday, July 11-Blarney Castle and Ring of Kerry</b><br/>After breakfast we'll drive to ""Kiss"" the Blarney Castle. This fifteenth-century tower house stands almost 90ft. in height and set in attractive grounds. In southwest Ireland it became popular to kiss the Blarney Stone. It is said to give the gift of eloquence. We'll spend some time exploring the magnificent grounds before heading out.<br/>In the afternoon we will go on a breath taking drive of the Iveragh Peninsula: the Ring of Kerry.<br/>Overnight Castle Hotel</p> <p>One wonders, in this place, why anyone is left in Dublin, or London, or Paris, when it would be better one would think, to live in a tent or a hut, with this magnificent sea and sky, and to breathe this wonderful air, which is like wine in one's teen. -J.M. Synge</p> <p><b>Wednesday, July 12-Killarney National Park &amp; Gap of Dunloe</b><br/>The Gap of Dunloe is one of Ireland's most exhilarating day trips! It has some of the best natural scenery seen anywhere in Ireland. Killarney National Park protects the glaciated limestone valley around three lakes. An excellent way to explore this area is the hike-on-boat tour. We will start at Kate Kearney's Cottage where we'll walk 8 miles through the Gap and over the head of the Gap. We will descend down Black Valley and continue to Lord Brandon's Cottage where we can have snacks or lunch. The next part of the journey is a 13 mile boat journey.<br/>Overnight Killarney</p> <p><b>Thursday, July 13-Skellig Island &amp; Dingle Peninsula and Cliffs of Moher.</b><br/>Today we will take one of the most exciting and inspiring trips you can take in Ireland-A voyage to the Skellig Islands. The magnificent Skellig Islands lie 8 miles off the coast of Portmagee in South West Kerry. Rising majestically from the sea, Skellig Michael towers 714ft. above sea level. On the summit of this awe-inspiring rock you will find a remarkably preserved sixth century monastic settlement. We will also explore the Ring of Skellig, a quiet, scenic though often very steep route around the most westerly promontory of teh Peninsula St. Finan's Bay. Note: Weather permitting for the ferry ride to Skellig Island, and we will not know if the ferry ride is running, until the day of. This is an optional activity, so you may choose to stay in Dingle town.<br/>After the Skellig Islands, we will visit the seaside town of Dingle and explore.</p> <p>In the late afternoon we will drive toward Galway, stopping at the Cliffs Of Moher (possibly for a sunset view). This is one of Ireland's top visitor attractions. The Cliffs are 214m high at the highest point and range for 8 kilometers over the Atlantic Ocean on the western seaboard. O'Brien's Tower stands proudly on a headland of the majestic Cliffs. From the Cliffs one can see the Aran Islands, Galway Bay, as well as The Twelve Pins, the Maum Turk Mountains in Connemara and Loop Head to the South. The Cliffs of Moher take their name from a ruined promontory fort ""Mothar"" which was demolished during the Napoleonic wars to make room for a signal tower.<br/>Overnight Galway</p> <p><b>Friday, July 14 and Saturday, July 15-Open Day in Galway</b><br/>The weekend is yours to enjoy on the coastal hip city of Galway. Known for its festivals, music, and bars, Galway is a vibrant, fun-loving city you will surely enjoy! You will have two whole days to enjoy this fast growing medieval city. Many of the pubs retain their original, huge fireplaces and other Gothic features. Enjoy the long pedestrianized main drag of William, Shop, High and Quay streets as it becomes a boisterous, Mediterranean-style promenade during the summer, lined with pub and restaurant tables. Highly recommended day trip to the Aran Islands!<br/>A day trip to the Aran islands is a great escape exploring one of the last Irish Gaelic speaking islands on the west coast of Ireland. Sitting in the mouth of Galway bay. Great 45min fast ferry to the Aran Islands exploring its limestone landscape a mere 18km long by 5km at its widest point.
